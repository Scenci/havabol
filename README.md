## Version control standards
Should make a new branch for each project that we make.

## Push/Pull
> git pull // Retrieves the latest code base from github including new branches.<br />
> git status // See what needs to be pushed, commited, or added.<br />
> git add <relative_file_path> // Adds files to the buffer to be committed. Note: . can be used to add whole directory <br />
> git commit -m <Message> // Commits the added files to github. Files are not uploaded to the website yet at this point.<br />
> git push // Uploads committed files to github.<br />

## Creating and switching to branches
> git branch [name] // Create a new branch<br />
> git checkout [name] // Switch to branch<br />
> git branch // Prints the current branch<br />
> git push origin [new branch] // push newly created branch to github<br />
