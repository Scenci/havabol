## Version control standards
Should make a new branch for each project that we make.

## Push/Pull
> git pull // Retrieves the latest code base from github including new branches.

> git status // See what needs to be pushed, commited, or added.

> git add <relative_file_path> // Adds files to the buffer to be committed. Note: . can be used to add whole directory

> git commit -m <Message> // Commits the added files to github. Files are not uploaded to the website yet at this point.

> git push // Uploads committed files to github.


## Creating and switching to branches
> git branch [name] // Create a new branch

> git checkout [name] // Switch to branch

> git branch // Prints the current branch

> git push origin [new branch] // push newly created branch to github
